with the associated press in kharkiv, ukraine, thursday, nov. 30, 2023. the year started with high hopes for ukrainian troops planning acounteroffensiveagainst russia. it ended with disappointment on the battlefield,an increasingly somber mood among troopsand anxiety about the future of western aid for ukraine swareffort. in between, there was a short-lived rebellion in russia, a dam collapse in ukraine, and the spilling of much blood on both sides of the conflict. twenty-two months since it invaded, russia has about one-fifth of ukraine in its grip, and the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line has barely budged this year. a crunch has come away from the battlefield. in western countries that havechampioned ukraine s struggleagainst its much bigger adversary, political deliberations over billions in financial aid are increasingly strained. russian president vladimir putinis playing a waiting game two years into a war that proved to be a costly miscalculation by the kremlin. he is wagering that the west s support will gradually crumble, fractured bypolitical divisions, eroded bywar fatigueand distracted by other demands, such as china s menacing of taiwan and war in the middle east. the international political outlook could turn sharply in putin s favor after next november s elections in the united states by far ukraine s biggest military supplier and where some republican candidates are pushing towind down support for its war. a dead body lies on the ground in front of a burning market after an attack in the city center of kostiantynivka, ukraine, wednesday, sept. 6, 2023. nearly half of the u.s. public believes the country is spending too much on ukraine,according to pollingpublished in november by the associated press-norc center for public affairs research. the political landscape on both sides of the atlantic is changing, says charles kupchan, a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations in washington dc. transatlantic solidarity has been steady. but i don t think it will remain steady forever. the shifting sentiment could benefit putin, analysts say, as he seeks at least to keep ukraine in limbo and eventually compel it to accept a bad deal to end the war. putin announced in early december that he willrun for reelectionin march, all but guaranteeing he keeps his repressive grip on russia for at least another six years. it s been a good year, i would even actually call it a great year for putin, says mathieu boulegue, a consulting fellow for the russia-eurasia program at chatham house think tank in london. western sanctionsare biting butnot cripplingthe russian economy. russian forces are still dictating much of what happens on the battlefield, where itsdefensive linesfeature minefields up to 20 kilometers (12 miles) deep that have largely held back ukraine s monthslong counteroffensive. the counteroffensive was launched before ukraine s forces were fully ready, a hurried political attempt to demonstrate that western aid could alter the course of the war, said marina miron of the defense studies department of king s college london. the expectations (for the counteroffensive) were unrealistic, she said. it turned out to be a failure. putin got a victory he desperately wanted in may in the fight for the bombed-out city of bakhmut, the longest and bloodiest battle of the war. it was a trophy to show russians after his army s winter offensive failed to take other ukrainian cities and towns along the front line. a mutiny in june by the wagner mercenary groupwas the biggest challenge to putin s authority in his more than two decades in power. but it backfired. putindefused the revoltand kept the allegiance of his armed forces, reasserting his hold on the kremlin. wagner chief and mutiny leader yevgeny prigozhin waskilled in a mysterious plane crash. and any public dissent about the war wasquickly and heavy-handedly stamped outby russian authorities. still, putin has had setbacks. he fell afoul of the international criminal court, which in march issued an arrest warrant for him on war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for theabductions of children from ukraine. that made it impossible for him to travel to many countries. ukraine has so far clawed back about half the land that the kremlin s forces occupied in their full-scale invasion in february 2022, according to the u.s., but it s going to be hard to win back more. the big ukrainian push fell far short of its ambitions, even though western countries had given kyiv avariety of weaponsand training. that has raised uncomfortable questions in the west about the best way forward. we re in a very awkward moment now, said kupchan of the council on foreign relations. a dove painted by artist tv boy adorns the wall of a building damaged by russian shelling attacks in irpin, ukraine, friday, july 7, 2023. the russians have been ruthless in their determination to stop the ukrainians punching through their lines. they were suspected of sabotaging the major kakhovka damon the dnieper river in southern ukraine, having possessed themeans, motive and opportunity to do so. the dam s collapseflooded a huge areawhere ukrainian forces might have may have been able to break through. for its part, ukraine has proved able to strike far behind enemy lines, evenhitting moscow with long-range drones. it has bloodied russia s nose by hitting with missiles and drones akey bridge in moscow-annexed crimea, oil depots and airfields, and theheadquarters of russia s black sea fleetin sevastopol. by showing it can strike in the black sea, ukraine has been able to push russian warships away from the coast, although not entirely. at one point, russia turned its sights on ukraine s black sea ports a vital conduit to global trade and its farming infrastructure,destroying enough foodto feed more than 1 million people for a year, the u.k. government said. yet while russia has endured huge losses of troops and equipment, the country possesses the scale to soak up those setbacks. cadets practice putting on gas masks during a lesson in a bomb shelter in a cadet lyceum in kyiv, ukraine, tuesday, june 6, 2023. writing on the wall reads: glory to ukraine . putin, who foreign officials say has secured large supplies ofammunition from north korea, has put together a state budget that devotes arecord amount to defenseas it increases spending by around 25 in 2024-2026. he has also ordered the country s military to increase the number of troops by nearly 170,000 to more than 1.3 million. for ukraine, the challenge is resourcing another offensive operation. its troops are motivated but exhausted, analysts say. zelenskyy has tirelessly lobbied western leaders to keep help coming, aware they are his country s lifeline. he has traveled to washington three times in the past two years. u.s president joe bidentraveled to kyivlast february in a display of western solidarity. he now wants congress to grant an additional 50 billionfor the war in ukraine. support for kyiv shows signs of fraying, however. biden s proposal isstuckin a divided senate. zelenskyy scored a diplomatic victory late in the year when the european union granted ukraine accelerated talks onjoining the bloc. but even that triumph was tempered by the knowledge that the process could take years, as could clinching nato membership. and the eu s denial of 50 billion euros ( 55 billion) in aid to help keep the battered ukrainian economy going wasfrustrating for kyiv. italian premier giorgia meloni perhapsexpressed the predicament most succinctlyin november when she inadvertently told a pair of russian prank callers that there is a lot of fatigue on the issue of ukraine. we are

(shandyba mykyta, ukrainian 10th mountain assault brigade edelweiss via ap, file) the main goal for the winter is to lose as few people as possible, said parker, the ukrainian commander of a mechanized battalion near bakhmutwho asked to go by his battlefield name to speak freely. bakhmut is a city in eastern ukraine that russian forces took after months of heavy fighting. we have to be clear, parker said. it s not possible in the winter to liberate donetsk or bakhmut, because they have too many (fighters). analysts say ukraine may even be forced to cede patches of previously reclaimed territory this winter, though russia is likely to pay a heavy price. if russia keeps on attacking, the most likely outcome is that they ll make some very marginal territorial gains, but suffer enormous casualties in doing so, said ben barry, a senior fellow at the international institute for strategic studies in london. some ukrainian commanders across the front line say they lack the fighters and firepower needed to keep russia s seemingly endless waves of infantrymen at arm s length as they fortify defenses to protect soldiers. that places ever more importance on attack drones a weapon, they say, that russia is currently better equipped with. indeed, while ukrainian soldiers have proven to be resourceful and innovative on the battlefield, moscow has dramatically scaled up its defense industry in the past year, manufacturing armored vehicles and artillery rounds at a pace ukraine cannot match. file - in this photo provided by the ukrainian 10th mountain assault brigade edelweiss , a ukrainian soldier holds an anti-drone gun on his position near bakhmut, donetsk region, ukraine, thursday, nov. 23, 2023. a gloomy mood hangs over ukraine s soldiers nearly two years after russia invaded their country. ukrainian soldiers remain fiercely determined to win, despite a disappointing counteroffensive this summer and signs of wavering financial support from allies. (shandyba mykyta, ukrainian 10th mountain assault brigade edelweiss via ap, file) yes they re ahead of us in terms of supply, said boxer, the commander in kherson, who credited russian drones with having longer range and more advanced software. it allows the drone to go up 2,000 meters, avoid jammers, he said, whereas ukrainian drones can fly only 500 meters. this poses a problem for his troops, who have been limited in their ability to strike russian targets on the other side of the dnieper river. to eventually deploy heavy weaponry, such as tanks, ukraine first needs to push russian forces back to erect pontoon bridges. until they get more drones, this won t be possible, said boxer. we wait for weapons we were supposed to receive months ago, he said. to sustain the fight, ukraine will also have to mobilize more men. in the northeastern cities of kupiansk and lyman, russian forces have deployed a large force with the goal of recapturing lost territory. they are simply weakening our positions and strongholds, injuring our soldiers, thereby forcing them to leave the battlefield, said dolphin, a commander in the northeast who would only be quoted using his battlefield name. dolphin says he has been unable to sufficiently re-staff. i can say for my unit, we are prepared 60 , he said. follow ap s coverage of the war in ukraine:https: apnews.com hub russia-ukraine"

(photo by maxym marusenko nur photo via ap) what trump said: you ve been there for three years. you should have ended it. ... you should have never started it. you could have made a deal. the facts: russia s army crossed the border on feb. 24, 2022, in an all-out invasion that putin sought to justifyby falsely saying it was needed to protect russian-speaking civilians in eastern ukraine and prevent the country from joining nato. but russia s aggression against ukraine didn t start then. in 2014, russian president vladimir putin saw signs that ukraine was pulling away from russia s sphere of influence, seeking alliances with western european nations. putin illegally annexed the crimean peninsula and started an armed aggression in the eastern ukrainian region of donbas that grew into a long-running conflict that left thousands dead. that conflict simmered until 2022, when putin ordered what he called military exercises along ukraine s borders. he told the world that the roughly 150,000 soldiers that he had amassed would not be used to invade ukraine. but in the early hours of feb. 24, russia launched widespread airstrikes and soldiers beganpouring over the border. what trump said: we have a situation where we haven t had elections in ukraine, where we have martial law, trump said in mar-a-lago, adding on wednesday in a post on social media: a dictator without elections, zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a country left. the facts: zelenskyy was elected to a five-year term in 2019, and the next presidential elections had been scheduled for spring 2024. but ukrainian law prohibits parliamentary or presidential elections during a state of martial law, so zelenskyy has remained in office. he has said he believes elections will be held in ukraine after martial law is lifted. the country would need to amend the law if it decided to hold a vote. there are numerous factors that,according to ukraine s government, would render it literally impossible to ensure a fair electoral process in the circumstances of a total war. according to the united nations refugee agency, some 6.9 million ukrainian refugees have been registered worldwide since february 2022. of those, millions remain outside the country due to the war. it would be nearly impossible for all of those who have been displaced to participate in an election, potentially robbing millions of their right to vote. furthermore, around 800,000 soldiers are currently serving in the ukrainian armed forces as they struggle to contain russian advances. an election would necessitate pulling soldiers off the front lines to vote, weakening ukraine s military position. additionally, those fighting would be unable to run for office, a right that is guaranteed to them by ukrainian law. many ukrainians are living in areas under russian occupation, essentially precluding their participation in any electoral process. and since russia continues to regularly strike both military and civilian targets across the country, packing millions of citizens into crowded polling places could create additional danger. what trump said: the leader in ukraine, i mean, i hate to say it, but he s down at 4 approval rating. the facts: zelenskyy retains a fairly high level of public trust about 57 percent - according to a report released wednesday by the kyiv international institute of sociology. speaking in kyiv on wednesday, zelenskyy said the number given by trump, for which the president cited no sources, was disinformation that originated in russia, and that the president unfortunately lives in this disinformation space. zelenskyy said he will ask pollsters in the coming weeks to conduct surveys on the public s trust in him and share the results with the trump administration. oleksii yukov s team members offload the bodies of russian soldiers they ve collected from the frontline in the sloviansk region, ukraine, tuesday, oct. 24, 2023. yukov and his team retrieve bodies from the frontline to barter for ukrainian bodies in periodic exchanges of war dead. what trump said: when you see what s taken place in ukraine with millions of people killed, including the soldiers, millions of people killed, a big percentage of their cities knocked down to the ground, i don t know how anybody even lives there. the facts: no estimates by any reputable analysis place deaths near the millions. while exact figures of the number of deaths are unknown, zelenskyy said earlier this month that over 46,000 ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the start of the full-scale war in february 2022. he has also said that tens of thousands of civilians had been killed in occupied areas of ukraine, but that no exact figures would be available until the war was over. the most recent data from the russian defense ministry, published in january 2023, pointed to just over 6,000 military deaths, although reports from u.s. and u.k. officials put that number significantly higher. what trump said: president zelenskyy said last week that he doesn t know where half of the money is that we gave him. well, we gave them, i believe, 350 billion. the facts: according to a u.s interagency oversight group that tracks aid to ukraine, the u.s. congress has appropriated around 183 billion in assistance to kyiv since the start of russia s invasion on feb. 24, 2022 a little more than half of trump s claim of 350 billion. in aninterview with the associated presson feb. 1, zelenskyy said some 70 billion worth of military aid had been delivered to ukraine, and that another 6 billion had come in the form of things like training programs, humanitarian relief and economic and infrastructure recovery. as for the rest of the assistance approved by the u.s. congress, zelenskyy said it never reached ukraine. i don t know where all this money is, he said. zelenskyy s statement led to a flurry of spurious claims in some news media, amplified by trump and elon musk, that some 100 billion of u.s. assistance had disappeared somewhere in ukraine. but crucially, aid appropriations aren t necessarily spent in the country they target. much of the ukraine aid approved by congress is spent in the u.s. to boost the domestic defense industry by replacing old equipment given to ukraine. it s also used to supply kyiv with new u.s.-manufactured weaponry. according to a paper from the center for strategic and international studies, a washington-based bipartisan, nonprofit policy research organization, other funds have financed a surge of u.s. troops into allied countries in europe in response to russia s invasion. still others have gone to assisting ukrainian refugees or enforcing sanctions against russia all uses that would never see funding cross over ukraine s borders. trump s own envoy for russia and ukraine, keith kellogg, said in an interview with broadcaster newsmax in early february that u.s. officials keep careful tabs on how and where aid appropriations are used."

russian military has repeatedly used missiles to blast civilian targets across the country, with devastating consequences. one of the biggest attacks occurred on friday when russia launched more than100 missiles and dozens of drones. the attack killed at least 24 civilians, injured another 130 and left an unknown number buried under rubble. western officials and analysts recently warned that russiahad limited its cruise missile strikes in recent months in an apparent effort to build up stockpiles for massive attacks during the winter, hoping to break ukrainians spirit. march 9, 2022 an apartment building in izium in eastern ukraine was hit in an attack that human rights watch later said killed at least 44 people. russian forces took control of the city and surrounding area beginning in late march andoccupied it for six months. at the time of the strike, hrw said the area was under the control of ukrainian forces who were trying to keep russian troops from entering the city. march 16, 2022 a russian airstrike hit a theater in mariupol, killing hundreds of civilians sheltering in the basement. ukrainian officials initially put the death toll at 300, but an associated press investigation later found evidence that the attack was fardeadlier and killed closer to 600 peopleinside and outside the building. russia claimed the theater was demolished by ukrainian forces or served as a ukrainian military base. april 8, 2022 thetrain station in kramatorskin eastern ukraine was hit by a russian missile as passengers, mostly women and children, tried to flee the fighting. sixty-one people were killed and 135 wounded. the remnants of a rocket were painted with the words for the children in russian, implying that children were being avenged by the strike, though the exact reason for the wording was unclear. ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said it was a deliberate attack. russia s defense ministry accused ukraine of carrying out the strike. june 27, 2022 long-range russian bombers struck a crowded shopping mall in ukraine s central city of kremenchukwith a supersonic missile, killing more than 20 people. about 1,000 people were inside the building. zelenskyy called the strike one of the most daring terrorist attacks in european history. russia said the missile was directed at a nearby weapons depot. july 1, 2022 a russian airstrike on residential areas killed at least 21 people near the ukrainian port of odesa, a day after the withdrawal of russian forces from an island in the black sea. zelenskyy s office said warplanes fired three missiles that struck an apartment building and a campsite. july 9, 2022 russian rockets smashed into apartment buildings in eastern ukraine,killing at least 15 peoplein the town of chasiv yar. the buildings were mostly home to people who work in nearby factories. at least six people were dug out of the rubble. july 14, 2022 kalibr cruise missiles fired from a russian ship in the black sea killed at least 29 people and wounded more than 100 others in the central ukrainian city of vinnytsia. zelenskyy accused russia of deliberately targeting civilians in locations with no military value. he said the victims included a 4-year-old girl. russia said it was attacking a ukrainian officers residence. sept. 30, 2022 four russian missiles targeted a convoy of cars on the outskirts of the southern city of zaporizhzhia, killing 30 people, including children. ukrainian officials said the missiles were launched from an s-300 anti-aircraft missile system and hit a column of vehicles sent to ferry people to safety from russian-occupied territory. jan. 14, 2023 one of thedeadliest attacks on civilianstook place when a russian missile hit an apartment building in the southeastern city of dnipro, killing 45 people, including six children. ukrainian military officials said at the time that they did not have a system that could take down the type of the supersonic missile that was used, russia s kh-22 missiles. april 28, 2023 an apartment blockfar from the front lines was blasted at night by two long-range cruise missiles in the city of uman, about 215 kilometers (134 miles) south of kyiv. at east 21 people were killed, including three children. the russian defense ministry said the missiles were aimed at places where ukrainian military reserve units were staying before their deployment to the battlefield. sept. 6, 2023 sixteen people were killed when a missile struck abusy market in kostiantynivkain eastern ukraine, turning it into a fiery, blackened ruin. zelenskyy said the strike was retribution for ukrainian advances on the battlefield. a russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said ukraine fired the missile. oct. 5, 2023 a village cafe and store in eastern ukraine was hit by a russian rocket, killing at least 51 civilians in one of the deadliest attacks of the year. zelenskyy denounced the strike in the village of hroza as a demonstrably brutal russian crime

as they take cover from russian shelling while being evacuated from a flooded neighborhood in kherson, ukraine, tuesday, june 6, 2023. kyiv, ukraine (ap) when tymofii postoiuk and his friends set up an online fundraising effort for ukraine, donations poured in from around the globe, helping to purchase essential equipment for ukrainian armed forces. as the fighting with russia wore on and war fatigue set in, the donations slowed down, but money continued to come in steadily. then the israel-hamas warbroke out on oct. 7. with the start of another major conflict, social media networks including x, formerly known as twitter, were flooded with news from the middle east. our fundraising posts and updates simply get lost in between those tweets, postoiuk said. the result has been a broad shift in the world s attention away from ukraine to the fighting in gaza a trend that worries many ukrainians. they fear that a combination of global fatigue, competing political agendas and limited resources will result in less aid for their military, hurting the country s ability to sustain its confrontation with russia. the longer we talk about our war, the less interest it holds for people, said 21-year-old ivan mahuriak, who lives in lviv in western ukraine. like many other ukrainians, he feels as if the world stopped paying attention to thewar in ukraineeven before the hamas attack on israel. the fatigue, he said, arises from the fact that dynamics on the ground are significantly less than in 2022, when ukrainian armed forces managed to completely or partiallypush russians out of several regions. in some places, the front line is still. but that doesn t mean that nothing is happening, he said. his brother, two cousins, several colleagues and friends are in the ukrainian military and continue to fight russian troops. this year s much-touted counteroffensive, which took off in june, has progressed at a much slower pace, with ukrainian troopsstruggling to dislodge russianswho are entrenched in captured territory. additional u.s. funding for ukraine is jeopardized by political fights in washington, where the new war consumes attention at the highest levels. divisions over ukraine have also emerged in the european union, which says itcannot provide all the munitions it promised. eu summits and other high-level global meetings now tend tofocus on the humanitarian catastrophe in gaza. united states president joe biden has made a point of linking u.s. support for israel and ukraine, saying both arevital for national security. biden s secretary of transportation, pete buttigieg, paid an official visit to ukraine on nov. 8 to show that the u.s. commitment has not wavered. the fact that i am here is one way to demonstrate that, in addition to the great concern and attention that we have toward what is going on in the middle east, we have as much attention, focus and commitment as we have ever had right here to ukraine, he said, standing outside of st. michael s church in kyiv. but many ukrainians are worried. president volodymyr zelenskyy acknowledged the fatigue earlier in november. yes. a lot of people, of course, in the world are tired, he said in an interview on nbc s meet the press. the war in the middle east also presents an opportunity to russian president vladimir putin by taking the spotlight off ukraine. of course, russia is very happy with this war, zelenskyy added. millions of ukrainians are burdened by the realization that the war russia initiated in their country won t end any time soon. no matter how frightening it may sound, i am preparing myself for the fact that this war will last my entire life, said zoya krasovska, a 34-year-old resident of lviv, who says her greatest fear is that allies will divert resources to other conflicts. it s akin to receiving a diagnosis of an incurable illness, where you don t stop living because of it, but you live with the awareness that it is with you forever, krasovska said. unlike 2022, when morale was high despite power outages, disrupted water service and blackouts, this year ukrainians face the frustration of the slow counteroffensive and shortages of sophisticated weapons.domestic politicshave become a greater focus. postoiuk, a netherlands-based development manager for the way to ukraine fund, said the team expected a decline in donations, but not to this extent. since the israel-hamas war broke out, it takes at least twice as long to raise enough money to buy a car for the army usually 8,000 to 14,000. through their work, they have collected nearly 147,000 money that supported 13 brigades and provided vehicles that included 15 pickups, three suvs, an ambulance and a drone. for the first time in the history of the fund, donations from within ukraine have exceeded those from abroad, he said. ukraine s war for independence is simply not on the agenda anymore, at least for now, he said. ivan bezdudnyi, a 26-year-old from kyiv, is consumed by the war in his country. for the past two years, he has been involved in documenting russian war crimes. little has changed for him personally since the outbreak of the war in the middle east. he does not worry that diminishing interest will affect ukraine s war for long. when the wave of interest in israel and hamas subsides, and i tend to think it won t last long the level of attention we had will remain, he said. maybe not as high as in february or march of last year, but probably higher than it is now. associated press writers lori hinnant in paris and samya kullab in kyiv, ukraine, contributed to this report. follow ap s coverage athttps: apnews.com hub russia-ukraine"

(ukrainian 47th brigade military video via ap) we will take everyone back, he promised. we just need some time. yukov says the same thing to all the mothers. he tells them to talk about their dead children, so they will be remembered. there is one person in particular whose story yukov does not want forgotten: oleksandr romanovych hrysiuk sasha, to his mother, olha. in a cryptic voice message last year, yukov urged olha to tell sasha s story. not everyone has such a story, he told her. but he left out the most important part: what it had cost him to bring sasha home. a main road leads to the frontline in the sloviansk region, ukraine, wednesday, oct. 25, 2023. the true toll of the war in ukraine and the odds faced by each side can be measured in bodies. more than half a million people have been killed or seriously injured in two years of war in ukraine, according to western intelligence estimates a human toll not seen in europe since world war ii. the question of who prevails is being increasingly shaped by which side can tolerate higher losses. by that measure, moscow has the upper hand. analysts say it will be hard for ukraine to outmatch russian forces, which continue to grow despite hundreds of thousands of casualties, without significant resources from its international partners. but the u.s. congress has not approved 60 billion in aid for ukraine, even as soldiers at the front run low on ammunition. oleksii yukov and his team members wait for colleagues to offload the bodies of russian soldiers they ve collected from the frontline in the sloviansk region, ukraine, oct. 24, 2023. putin is not running a democracy, said evelyn farkas, a former senior pentagon official for russia and ukraine who now heads the mc cain institute at arizona state university. putin can afford to be more callous and disregard the body count. ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy, on the other hand, is presiding over a more democratic system, where the will of the people is actually the strongest component of their war machine. russia had 3.7 times more men of fighting age than ukraine in 2022, according to world bank data. that means that though russia has sustained nearly twice as many casualties as ukraine, according to western intelligence estimates, on a per capita basis russia s losses remain lower than ukraine s. at current levels of recruitment, the kremlin can sustain current attrition rates through 2025, according to an assessment by the royal united services institute (rusi), a think tank in london. meanwhile, ukraine this week took the politically difficult step of lowering the military conscription age from 27 to 25 in an effort to replenish its ranks. manpower is another currency, said nick reynolds, a research fellow at rusi. the russians with their industrial base and larger manpower can expend manpower and materiel at less cost. have a news tip? contact ap s global investigative team at email protected .for secure and confidential communications, use the free signal app 1 (202) 281-8604. yukov understands that for people far away, war is geopolitics, death can be counted in numbers, and money matters more than men. but he knows better. war has one face, he said. death and stupidity and horror. oleksii yukov says the same thing to all the ukrainian mothers. he tells them to talk about their dead children, so they will be remembered. it is yukov s job to bring the dead home, one body at a time. (ap video bram janssen and anton shtuka) the last time olha hrysiuk spoke with her son, sasha asked about the spring crops, the vegetable garden, their horses and cows, were the chickens laying many eggs? the conversation went on, as if they had all the time in the world. it was may 15, 2022. sasha vanished the next day. for three days, olha knew only silence. she accepted it, because sasha had told her he was going on a mission and might be out of touch. on the fourth day, she called the head of her village, who called the nearest military office, who contacted his military unit, who said that sasha was missing. sasha wasn t a born fighter. an athlete, he studied physiotherapy before he was drafted and packed off on april 3, 2022. olha gave him a silver cross on a chain to hang around his neck as he went into battle. where was her boy now, she wondered, the kid with the sweet smile and ears that stuck out, who loved to run and had so many friends she couldn t keep count? where was her son, who dreamed of building a home for the family he did not yet have? in ukraine, we have a saying that god takes the best away, olha said. i think this is the case. oleksii yukov inspects the necklace of a deceased russian soldier in sloviansk region, ukraine, tuesday, oct. 24, 2023. after pleading on social media for information, olha s daughter-in-law managed to speak directly with some soldiers from sasha s unit. they said sasha was dead. they were very sorry they couldn t take his body with them, the shelling was too heavy, all they could do was hide him in a cellar in dovhenke a rural settlement in eastern ukraine that fell to the russians. they would write his name on the shells they fired because they loved him too. he was a hero, they said. in this photo from april 2022 provided by his family, oleksandr sasha romanovych hrysiuk, in uniform, poses next to a luxury automobile in ukraine s mykolaiv region. (courtesy olha hrysiuk via ap) sasha, 27 years old, had lasted exactly six weeks at war. it was time for him to come home. if olha couldn t have her son back, she d take whatever pieces were left. but how? olha started making calls, so many that she had to buy a notebook to keep track. she said she called the ukrainian red cross, the international committee of the red cross, ukraine s national information bureau, the ukrainian military, the coordination headquarters for the treatment of prisoners of war, every hotline and volunteer group she could find. she emailed the commissioner for human rights and wrote letters to the ministry of defense and even to president zelenskyy himself. she wrote down who answered, who didn t, and, mostly, who told her to wait, wait, wait. for six months, olha tried. i just could not live without trying, she said. how is it possible to not even see the bones of your child! i was even ready to go to dovhenke myself! in the end, people told her that if black tulip couldn t bring sasha home, no one could. black tulip is the name of the network of volunteer body collectors yukov worked with back in 2014, when russia seized crimea and pushed into eastern ukraine. black tulip has since disbanded but the name stuck. yukov went on to found his own group,called platsdarm, which can be translated as bridgehead, to continue black tulip s mission. it is yukov s job to bring everyone back. he has collected the fragments of a man scattered across the trees and restored the scraps to the soldier s mother. he has pulled hot human remains from a smoldering helicopter. once, a mother asked him to please retrieve her son s arm, which she d heard was left dangling in a particular tree; he did. he has rooted through feces to retrieve the finger bones and teeth of men whose corpses were eaten by pigs. listen, if your child was killed, you would gnaw through this s with your teeth to bury the body, he said. yukov is racing against time, which eats up corpses, to bring all the souls home. but there are too many. he can t fit them all in his car, no matter if he straps them to the roof, carries them in his hands. they overwhelm him. sometimes i just want to scream. to yell. because you realize what madness and pain it is, he said. i understand that i do not have enough life to finish this work of searching for the dead. yukov s story is the story of the bloodlands of ukraine, a landscape transformed by generations of conflict. he grew up cold and hungry in sloviansk, in eastern ukraine, one of five children. they made it through one winter by foraging dried peas packed in his brother s punching bag. he learned to share, down to his last piece of bread. when yukov was around six, a local cemetery got dug up to make way for a new children s hospital. bulldozers heaved piles of clothes and bones; children ran around playing with skulls stuck on the end of sticks. he was shocked and ashamed as he stood before the unburied dead. i looked at the bones and thought, crap these are people! yukov recalled. what if my relatives are buried in this place? the forests of yukov s childhood were filled with the bones of german and soviet soldiers from world war ii, some so densely strewn they looked like snow. he started searching for the dead when he was thirteen, but at first he made mistakes. the souls he offended or failed to find haunted him. he felt them poke his ribs as he slept and he woke up dizzy, his nose bleeding. why do you keep coming? he demanded of his phantoms. what do you need? as a boy, he dreamt he was running in a forest, jumping over pits and trenches until he tumbled into a hole, falling deep into ruby-colored light. he smelled the bodies before he saw them, bones sliding beneath his feet as he sank. someone grabs me by the scruff of the neck, whispering, we have to be buried, he recalled. he woke up wet with sweat. he knew what he had to do. until they are buried according to their traditions and rituals, a soul will suffer. so it s very important for me, even if it is an enemy, to return them home to be buried properly, for their souls to be calm, yukov said. collectors of souls is what the locals call us. in late summer 2022, olha and her other son reached out to yukov, seeking help. they sent along photos of sasha and his tattoo, as well as satellite images of his approximate location. yukov got to dovhenke in september, not long after the russians left. more than 90 percent of buildings there had been destroyed or damaged, and it was hard to find the cellar where sasha s unit said they d left him. also, there were mines. they spent days searching. on sept. 19, yukov took a step and heard a click. the force of the explosion knocked him to the ground. i was laying there and i felt like i had no legs, yukov said. i was like, it s fine, i ll get a prosthesis. ... but i saw holes and blood spraying from my legs. i was like, ok. legs are in place. but suddenly, i can t see with my eye. there s no eye. his team came running for him, screaming. stop! don t run, stand still! yukov hollered back, worried they d get blown up too. bring tourniquets and a stretcher! they drove him to the hospital fast, in silence, their dog panting above the high whine of the straining engine. yukov was limp in the backseat, legs cinched with tourniquets. he gingerly touched a bloodied white cloth to the spot where his right eye used to be. two weeks later, yukov led everyone back to dovhenke, his eye patched like a pirate, and stumbled around on crutches trying to find sasha. but it was still too dangerous, and they had to wait another few weeks for the mines to be cleared. by then, yukov had a new glass eye, which looks incredibly real until he raps on it with his knuckles. when they finally got back to dovhenke to search for sasha, a small grey kitten with an injured nose kept jumping on yukov s shoulder, nuzzling him. the cat circled one spot in the wreckage. they started digging there. in this image from video provided by platsdarm, a group of body collectors led by oleksii yukov, a kitten nuzzles yukov in dovhenke, ukraine in november 2022, during a search for oleksandr sasha romanovych hrysiuk. (platsdarm via ap) souls come over and wander next to us, yukov explained. a sign came to show us where he was lying ... he wants to be back home. mother is waiting. sasha was pancaked beneath the rubble of a collapsed building. the place was scorched. there were fragments of 120mm mortars and signs of a massive blast. by the time they d pried through the last layers of concrete, it was dark. denys sosnenko, a 21-year-old who yukov used to coach at kickboxing, went down in the pit to comb the dirt with his fingers, looking for bones. yukov told denys to try to keep the fragments of sasha s head together in what was left of his helmet. he handed part of sasha s skull, wet and yellowed, to yukov, who placed it gently down in a large white bag. it was hard to keep track of all the pieces because it was pitch black and they were working by flashlight. denys pulled out a silver, soil-caked cross and set it aside, then a spoon and a watch. yukov went on, making a rough anatomical inventory of what was left of sasha. an arm. the backbone. pelvis. femur. elbow. wait, yukov said. where is the other arm and shoulder blade? it was nov. 25, 2022. two months later, denys drove over a landmine while searching for bodies and died. as in most wars, both sides have downplayed or obscured their losses, and the true toll may not be known for years. but from the sky, the multitudes of dead are already transforming the landscape. the graves look the same on both sides of the front: fields, once empty, now quilted with patchworks of fresh tombstones. president zelenskyy recently said that 31,000 ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the war, less than half what western intelligence has estimated. russia s losses are thought to be roughly double ukraine s. using satellite imagery and site visits, the associated press documented the rapid growth of soldiers graves at a few key sites in russia and ukraine where the war dead have accumulated at scale. by march, more than 650 soldiers lay in what was open land outside lviv two years ago, and there were more than 800 new soldiers graves in one kyiv cemetery. some 700 graves appeared in two plots for soldiers in a kharkiv cemetery between feb. 2022 through sept. 2023, satellite images show. the ap also counted at least 1,345 new soldiers graves at a dnipro cemetery in march, edged by six neat rows of empty pits in the earth waiting for more bodies. many more dead are scattered across both ukraine and russia, discreetly tucked among civilian graves. mediazona, an independent russian media outlet, has identified the locations of dozens of russian cemeteries that have swelled with war dead. along with the bbc s russia service and a network of volunteers, they ve confirmed the deaths of around 50,000 russian soldiers killed since the full-scale invasion, a number they say probably captures just over half of the true death toll. their count does not include russian fighters from occupied territories in ukraine. this combination of satellite images provided by maxar technologies shows an increase in storage space for cremated remains at a wagner chapel in russia s southern krasnodar region from dec. 10, 2021 to sept. 25, 2023. (maxar technologies via ap) the dead cannot be hidden from space. satellite images show more than 750 graves at the wagner cemetery in bakinskaya, a town near the black sea, up from around 170 in jan. 2023. about 15 kilometers (9 miles) away, an estimated 2,646 compartments for cremated remains have been built into new rows of dark grey walls at the wagner chapel, though it wasn t possible to say how many were filled. the number of war dead buried at the federal military memorial cemetery north of moscow, has tripled in the last year, to an estimated 846 graves. these are the lucky ones, the ones who made it home. this combination of satellite images provided by maxar technologies and planet labs shows the federal military memorial cemetery in mytishchi, russia on oct. 7, 2021; june 19, 2023 and march 3, 2024, with an increasing number of graves. (maxar technologies, planet labs via ap) yukov says he s collected over 1,000 bodies since the full-scale invasion began two years ago, more than half of them russians. we are not fighting the dead, he said. i don t separate the bodies of russian soldiers and ukrainian soldiers. they are all souls for me. one night in october, yukov returned from a mission near sloviansk with black body bags strapped to the roof of his car. they bounced perilously over potholes, as he sped to deliver the cargo to a morgue. the count that day was 11 russians and one leg, which was probably ukrainian, judging by its boot. their wounds would be documented. the things they carried amulets that hadn t worked, kids drawings, family photos, letters of love and despair would be collected and cataloged. their dna would be tested, if necessary, and their identities logged in government databases. the ukrainians, yukov hoped, would find their way home. the russians would become currency to barter for ukrainian bodies in periodic exchanges of war dead. oleksii yukov, second right, and other body collectors carry the body of a russian soldier that was exhumed from a shell crater in front of destroyed school in virnopillia, ukraine, july 6, 2023. when someone says, i am tired of war, yes, we are all tired, yukov said. but we just need you to understand: help us. don t stand aside. because war has no borders. war will cross your doorstep too. he peered into a body bag. the corpses had baked in the sun and the meat of their faces was partly mummified. yukov figured they d been dead for around three months. suddenly angry, yukov began speaking in agitated russian. you carried this child in your womb, he said, now your russian boys are lying here, in ukrainian soil. why did you let them come here? you knew what this was all about, that they were going to kill and be killed. yukov looked down at the bodies laid out on the night grass. this is where it all ends, he said. he turned away and let out a little laugh, then stopped talking and shook his head in silence. so, i don t know it s stupidity. oleksii yukov examines the body of a russian soldier he collected on the frontline in the sloviansk region, ukraine, oct. 24, 2023. olha hoped for a long time that missing meant alive. but when yukov sent a photograph of the necklace they d found in the cellar in dovhenke, olha recognized it instantly. it was the same silver jesus she d given sasha when he left for war, only now it was an exhibit, number 3118, mud-flecked evidence of the dead. olha never got to see her son s face again. by the time she got the body back, sasha had no face anymore. this was hard for her because it allowed her to nurture a tiny, painful hope that there had been some mistake. yukov is a destroyer of hope for mothers. but they thank him anyway. i am glad we managed to do it, yukov messaged olha, after he found sasha. we hug you and hope that we can meet you to get to know more about him. we are holding the sky together with you. your work is priceless, she replied. olha buried what was left of sasha on march 16, 2023 in her village cemetery, beneath a cross bandaged with flowers and ribbons. it s very important for me to know his body is next to me, olha said. we are all waiting for victory. for me, it s the most important thing. if we do not win, what did my son die for and so many other sons? yukov never told olha he d lost an eye trying to find her son. this photo provided by the family shows the grave of oleksandr sasha romanovych hrysiuk, who was buried in kvitneve, ukraine, in march 2023. (courtesy olha hrysiuk via ap) when she heard what had happened, she nodded faintly, her frown deepening to an expression of infinite sadness. i cannot express with words how grateful i am, she said. she opened her hands and looked up, searching for sounds that could convey the enormity of loss. i m so shocked ... as long as i live, i will remember the sacrifice he made for me and my family. olha visits sasha s grave every day, to sit with him, talk with him and pray that he and perhaps she herself finds peace. whatever people say, i know sasha wanted to come home, olha said. sometimes i watch tv, the internet, tik tok, whatever, and i think: that s it, we lost. i feel like giving up but when i watch videos of oleksii (yukov), i want to keep helping. if there are people like oleksii, nothing is lost yet in ukraine. ap journalists michael biesecker in washington and volodymyr yurchuk and vasilisa stepanenko in ukraine contributed to this report."

oct. 10, 2023. many ukrainians are expecting the same or worse this coming winter and have spent months preparing, including collecting firewood and buying generators. moshchun, ukraine (ap) in the humble backyard of a destroyed house, a 13-year-old chops firewood to get ready for winter. his mother, tetiana yarema, has been preparing for months as she remembers last winter s russian strikes on the energy infrastructure that plunged ukraine into darkness. those were dark days. i didn t want anything. i just wanted to pack my things and go abroad, said yarema, 48, who says she ended up staying because of her son s insistence. for the yarema family, like millions of other ukrainians touched by russia s war on ukraine, winter is an especially challenging time. the mother and son live in trailers that were set up in their backyard after fighting in the early days of the war destroyed their house in moshchun, a village about 25 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of kyiv. i have a feeling that when the cold sets in, they ll start bombing again, the woman said, echoing the sentiments of many ukrainians. this time, however, they say they are better prepared. sales of generators exploded toward the end of summer. some, who can afford it, have invested in solar panels. others, like yarema, have been purchasing candles, batteries, flashlights, and portable lanterns and stocking up on compact gas canisters, making the most of discounted prices. anatoliy fedorko, 56, chops wood near his house in moshchun, near kyiv, ukraine, tuesday, oct. 10, 2023. it s a bit challenging but i already know what to do, she said. last winter was declared the most challenging in the history of ukraine s energy system, with over 1,200 missiles and drones fired by russians at power plants, according to ukrainian state-owned grid operator, ukrenergo. the strikes impacted almost a half of ukraine s energy capacity. people were forced to endure hours without electricity and water during the coldest months in what ukrainian officials described as energy terror. millions of people across ukraine had to learn to work, live, and cover their basic needs without relying on electricity. artem yarema, 13, carries wood near his family s house in moshchun, near kyiv, ukraine, tuesday, oct. 10, 2023. after a lull of six months, ukraine s energy system sustained its first attack of the season on sept. 21, resulting in damage to facilities in the central and western regions, ukrenergo said. ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy has committed to substantially enhancing air defense systems, which already have demonstrated greater effectiveness than the previous year. everyone must play their part in defensive efforts to ensure that russian aggression does not halt ukraine this winter. just as on the battlefield, in all areas, we must be resilient and strong, zelenskyy said in a recent address to the nation. ukrainian prime minister denys shmyhal recently announced that the united states has allocated 522 million for energy equipment and the protection of ukraine s infrastructure. we stand on the threshold of a difficult winter. thanks to the assistance of our allies, we successfully weathered the last, which was the most challenging winter season in our history, shmyhal said. andriy gorghinskyy 49, is seen in his parent s house with autonomous heating in the village of malyutyanka near kyiv, ukraine, tuesday, oct. 10, 2023. major retailer epicenter said sales of generators increased 80 in august compared to the same time last year, and sales of portable charging stations increased by 25 times. yurii musienko, 45, another resident of moshchun, also plans to rely heavily on firewood, and has a wood-burning stove in his compact wooden trailer that has been provided to him for two years, and which sits next to his ruined home. i ve already adapted, he said with a smile. the gates of his home still bear the holes from exploded ammunition that serve as a reminder of when russian forces tried to seize the ukrainian capital. may no one ever have to endure such conditions, said his mother, valentyna kiriian, who lives in a separate plastic trailer installed in the same courtyard. she s dressed in a hat and a coat, with multiple layers of clothing to stay warm. she notes that the cold has already set in, forcing her to sleep fully clothed, much like the previous winter. during the power outages last winter, the mother and son relied on canned food. occasionally, valentyna would visit her neighbor, whose house remained intact and had a gas stove for boiling water. it s difficult for me to talk about. it pains my soul, and my heart weeps, she said. private ukrainian energy producer dtek has spent the last seven months restoring its damaged infrastructure and fortifying the protection of its equipment for the approaching winter. the company invested about 20 billion ukrainian hryvnias ( 550 million) to prepare for the upcoming season, and it lost billions of hryvnias because of last year s disruptions caused by russian attacks, according to ceo maxim timchenko. we learned our lessons, timchenko said. andrii horchynskyi, 49. who lives in the village of maliutianka about 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of kyiv, has invested over 30,000 in recent years to ensure his house is self-sufficient, and ramped up those efforts since russia s invasion. last year, he spent 12,000 to install solar panels to help power his spacious house, where other members of his extended family came to stay for the winter eight of them surviving comfortably. we had a whole ant heap here, horchynskyi recalled. he is convinced the russians will try to damage ukraine s infrastructure for gas, which he thinks will become expensive or even unavailable. so, he has installed a boiler that burns pine pellets. he also stores one and half cubic meters of water in his backyard. they will bombard even more this winter than the last, horchynskyi said. dmytro zhyhinas contributed to this report. follow ap s coverage of the war in ukraine:https: apnews.com hub russia-ukraine"

(dec. 1) (ap video srdjan nedeljkovic and felipe dana). ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy, commander of ukraine s ground forces col.-gen. oleksandr syrsky, right, and roman mashovets, deputy

30, 2023. kharkiv, ukraine (ap) ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy saysthe war with russiais in a new stage, with winter expected to complicate fighting after a summer counteroffensive that failed to produce desired results due to enduring shortages of weapons and ground forces. despite setbacks, however, he said ukraine won t give up. we have a new phase of war, and that is a fact, zelenskyy said in an exclusive interview thursday with the associated press in kharkiv in northeastern ukraine after a morale-boosting tour of the region. winter as a whole is a new phase of war. asked if he was satisfied by the results ofthe counteroffensive, he gave a complex answer. look, we are not backing down, i am satisfied. we are fighting with the second (best) army in the world, i am satisfied, he said, referring to the russian military. but he added: we are losing people, i m not satisfied. we didn t get all the weapons we wanted, i can t be satisfied, but i also can t complain too much. zelenskyy also said he fears the israel-hamas warthreatens to overshadow the conflict in ukraine, as competing political agendas and limited resources put the flow of western military aid to kyiv at risk. and those concerns are amplified by the tumult that inevitably arises during a u.s. election year and its potential implications for his country, which has seen the international community largely rally around it following russia s feb. 24, 2022, invasion. ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy, commander of ukraine s ground forces col.-gen. oleksandr syrsky, right, and roman mashovets, deputy head of the presidential office, look at a map during their visit to the front-line city of kupiansk, kharkiv region, ukraine, thursday, nov. 30, 2023. the highly anticipated counteroffensive, powered by tens of billions of dollars in western military aid, including heavy weaponry, did not forge the expected breakthroughs. now, some ukrainian officials worry whether further assistance will be as generous. at the same time, ammunition stockpiles are running low, threatening to bring ukrainian battlefield operations to a standstill. withwinter set to cloak a wartime ukraineonce again, military leaders must contend with new but familiar challenges as the conflict grinds toward the end of its second full year: there are freezing temperatures and barren fields that leave soldiers exposed. and there s the renewed threat of widespread russian aerial assaults in cities that target energy infrastructure and civilians. on nov. 25,moscow launched its most extensive drone attackof the war, with most of the 75 iranian-made shahed drones targeting kyiv in a troubling precedent for the months ahead. that is why a winter war is difficult, zelenskyy said. he gave a frank appraisal of the last summer s counteroffensive. we wanted faster results. from that perspective, unfortunately, we did not achieve the desired results. and this is a fact, he said. ukraine did not get all the weapons it needed from allies, he said, and limits in the size of his military force precluded a quick advance, he said. ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy gestures as he talks during his interview with james jordan, news director for europe and africa for the associated press in kharkiv, ukraine, thursday, nov. 30, 2023. there is not enough power to achieve the desired results faster. but this does not mean that we should give up, that we have to surrender, zelenskyy said. we are confident in our actions. we fight for what is ours. white house national security council spokesman john kirby, responding to zelenskyy s comments about military aid, said the u.s. provided unprecedented support. i certainly can t dispute president zelenskyy s estimation that they haven t achieved the success that they had hoped to achieve, kirby said. but i can assure you that the united states has done everything we can. u.s. president joe biden s administration wants to give more but faces resistance from republican representatives in congress, kirby said. and if we don t get that support from congress, the message it is going to send around the world about how much ukraine matters and how much the united states and our leadership can deliver to our partners around the world is going to be loud and clear and deeply unfortunate, kirby said. zelenskyy said there were some positive takeaways from the last few months. ukraine managed to make incremental territorial gains against a better-armed and fortified enemy, zelenskyy said. in addition, the might of moscow s black sea fleethas been diminished, following ukrainian attacks that penetrated air defenses and struck its headquarters in occupied crimea, zelenskyy added. and a temporary grain corridor established by kyiv following russia s withdrawal from a wartime agreement to ensure the safe exports is still working. zelenskyy, though, isn t dwelling on the past but is focused on the next stage boosting domestic arms production. ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy reacts during his interview with the associated press in kharkiv, ukraine, thursday, nov. 30, 2023. a sizeable chunk of ukraine s budget is allocated for that, but current output is far from enough to turn the tide of war. now, zelenskyy is looking to western allies, including the u.s., to offer favorable loans and contracts to meet that goal. this is the way out, zelenskyy said, adding that nothing terrifies russia more than a militarily self-sufficient ukraine. when he last met with biden, members of congress and other top officials, he made one urgent appeal: give ukraine cheap loans and licenses to manufacture u.s. weaponry. give us these opportunities, and we will build, he said he told them. whatever effort and time it will take, we will do it, and we will do it very quickly. zelenskyy remains concerned that upheaval in the middle east, the most violent in decades, threatens to take global attention and resources away from ukraine s ability to defend itself. we already can see the consequences of the international community shifting (attention) because of the tragedy in the middle east, he said. only the blind don t recognize this. ukrainians understand that we also need to fight for attention for the full-scale war, he said. we must not allow people to forget about the war here. that change in focus could lead to less economic and military assistance for his country, he said. in an apparent attempt to assuage those fears, u.s. and european officials have continued to visit kyiv since the oct. 7 attacks in israel. the shift still concerns him, zelenskyy said. you see, attention equals help. no attention will mean no help. we fight for every bit of attention, he said. without attention, there may be weakness in (the u.s.) congress. turning to the upcoming u.s. presidential and congressional campaigns, where biden faces skepticism over his staunch support for kyiv, zelenskyy acknowledged that elections are always a shock, and it is completely understandable. ukrainian defense minister rustem umerov rides in an apc during a visit to the front-line city of kupiansk, kharkiv region, ukraine, thursday, nov. 30, 2023. a recent ap poll in the u.s. showed nearly half of americans think too much is being spent on ukraine. an increasing number of republicans are not in favor of sending more aid, and it is not clear if or when a request from the white house for additional aid will be approved by congress. when asked about this, zelenskyy replied bluntly that the choice of americans is the choice of americans. but he argued that by helping ukraine, americans are also helping themselves. in the case of ukraine, if resilience fails today due to lack of aid and shortages of weapons and funding, it will mean that russia will most likely invade nato countries, he said. and then the american children will fight. zelenskyy has sought recently to ensure ukraine s war machine was running as it should by making a recent shakeup of top-level government officials, touching on another of his goals to fight graft in a post-soviet institution rife with corruption as a prelude to joining the european union. he said he has to know how weapons, supplies, food and even clothing are being delivered to the front and what fails to get there. on one hand, this is not the job of the president, but on the other hand, i can trust those who did not just pass on the information to me, but told me in person, he said. the static battle lines have not brought pressure from ukraine s allies to negotiate a peace deal with russia. i don t feel it yet, he said, although he added: some voices are always heard. ukraine wants to push the formula for peace and involve as many countries of the world as possible, so that they politically isolate russia, he noted. the war has also made it impossible to hold a presidential election in ukraine, originally slated for march under the constitution, he said. although zelenskyy said he was ready to hold an election, most ukrainians are not, believing such a vote to be dangerous and meaningless as war rages around them. with a budget anticipating spending 22 of the country s gdp for defense and national security, ukraine s economy is being restructured around a war with no end in sight, much like the day-to-day lives of its citizens. that raised another question: how long can zelenskyy himself cope with being the leader of a country at war? there are no words to describe how difficult the job is, he said, but he also can t imagine leaving the post. you honestly can t do that, he said. this would be very unfair, wrong and definitely demotivating. follow ap s coverage of the war in ukraine athttps:

(russian defense ministry press service photo via ap, file) its full-scale invasion three years ago left russia holding a fifth of ukraine, and ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyyhas hinted that he hopes controlling kursk will help force moscow to negotiate an end to the war. but five ukrainian and western officials in kyiv who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss sensitive military matters said they fear gambling on kursk will weaken the whole 1000-kilometer (621-mile) front line, and ukraine is losing precious ground in the east. we have, as they say, hit a hornet s nest. we have stirred up another hot spot, said stepan lutsiv, a major in the 95th airborne assault brigade. army chief oleksandr syrskyi has said that ukraine launched the operation because officials thought russia was about to launch a new attack on northeast ukraine. it began on aug. 5 with an order to leave ukraine s sumy region for what they thought would be a nine-day raid to stun the enemy. it became an occupation that ukrainians welcomed as their smaller country gained leverage and embarrassed russian president vladimir putin. gathering his men, one company commander told them: we re making history; the whole world will know about us because this hasn t been done since world war ii. privately, he was less certain. it seemed crazy, he said. i didn t understand why. shocked by the success achieved largely because the russians were caught by surprise, the ukrainians were ordered to advance beyond the original mission to the town of korenevo, 25 kilometers (16 miles) into russia. that was one of the first places where russian troops counterattacked. residents sit near a shelter in sudzha, russia, on aug. 16, 2024, near a sign that reads, civilians in a basement. no military, in an image approved by the ukrainian defense ministry before publication. by early november the russians began regaining territory rapidly. once in awe of what they accomplished, troops opinions are now shifting as they come to terms with losses. the company commander said half of his troops were dead or wounded. some front-line commanders said conditions are tough, morale is low and troops are questioning command decisions, even the very purpose of occupying kursk. fellow soldiers carry petro velykiy s coffin during a funeral, nov. 27, 2024, at the theater in chernyhiv, ukraine, for the 48-year-old actor who was killed in a battle with russian troops in the kursk region. another commander said that some orders his men have received don t reflect reality because of delays in communication. delays occur especially when territory is lost to russian troops, he said. they don t understand where our side is, where the enemy is, what s under our control, and what isn t, he said. they don t understand the operational situation, we so act at our own discretion. one platoon commander said higher-ups have repeatedly turned down his requests to change his unit s defensive position because he knows his men can t hold the line. those people who stand until the end are ending up mia, he said. he said he also knows of at least 20 ukrainian soldiers whose bodies had been abandoned over the last four months because the battles were too intense to evacuate them without more casualties. ukrainian soldiers said they were not prepared for the aggressive russian response in kursk, and cannot counterattack or pull back. there s no other option. we ll fight here because if we just pull back to our borders, they won t stop; they ll keep advancing, said one drone unit commander. ukraine s general staff told the associated press in a written response to questions that ukrainian combat units are inflicting losses to russian personnel and military equipment on a daily basis, and are provided with everything necessary to carry out combat duties. troops are managed in accordance to situational awareness and operational information, taking into the account the operational situation in areas where tasks are performed, the response said. american longer-range weaponshave slowed the russian advance and north korean soldierswho joined the fighting last month are easy targets for drones and artillery because they lack combat discipline and often move in large groups in the open, ukrainian troops said. on monday, zelenskyy said 3,000 north korean soldiers had been killed and wounded. but they appear to be learning from their mistakes, soldiers added, by becoming more adept at camouflaging near forested lines. one clash took place last week near vorontsovo tract, a forested area between the settlements of kremenne and vorontsovo. until last week, the area was under ukraine s control. this week part of it has been lost to russian forces and ukrainian troops fear they will reach a crucial logistics route. eyeing frontline losses in the eastern region known as the donbas where russia is closing on a crucial supply hub some soldiers are more vocal about whether kursk has been worth it. all the military can think about now is that donbas has simply been sold, the platoon commander said. at what price?"

a shell-shocked ukrainian soldier of the azov brigade sits at the stabilization point after arriving from the front line, near toretsk, donetsk region, ukraine, on sept. 24, 2024. this problem is critical, said oleksandr kovalenko, a kyiv-based military analyst. this is the third year of war, and this problem will only grow. although moscow has also been dealing with desertions, ukrainians going awol have laid bare deeply rooted problems bedeviling their military andhow kyiv is managing the war, from the flawed mobilization drive to the overstretching and hollowing out of front-line units. it comes as the u.s. urges ukraine to draft more troops,and allow for the conscription of those as young as 18. the associated press spoke to two deserters, three lawyers, and a dozen ukrainian officials and military commanders. officials and commanders spoke on condition of anonymity to divulge classified information, while one deserter did so because he feared prosecution. file - ukraine s khartia brigade officer, who goes by callsign kit, left, sits while his soldiers pilot drones in a shelter on the frontline near kharkiv, ukraine, on nov. 7, 2024. it is clear that now, frankly speaking, we have already squeezed the maximum out of our people, said an officer with the 72nd brigade, who noted that desertion was one of the main reasons ukrainelost the town of vuhledarin october. more than 100,000 soldiers have been charged under ukraine s desertion lawssince russia invadedin february 2022, according to the country s general prosecutor s office. nearly half have gone awol in the last year alone, after kyiv launched anaggressive and controversial mobilization drivethat government officials and military commanders concede has largely failed. it s a staggeringly high number by any measure, as there were an estimated 300,000 ukrainian soldiers engaged in combat before the mobilization drive began. and the actual number of deserters may be much higher. one lawmaker with knowledge of military matters estimated it could be as high as 200,000. many deserters don t return after being granted medical leave. bone-tired by the constancy of war, they arepsychologically and emotionally scarred. they feel guilt about being unable to summon the will to fight, anger over how the war effort is being led, and frustration that it seems unwinnable. being quiet about a huge problem only harms our country, said serhii hnezdilov, one of few soldiers to speak publicly about his choice to desert. he was charged shortly after the ap interviewed him in september. another deserter said he initially left his infantry unit with permission because he needed surgery. by the time his leave was up, he couldn t bring himself to return. he still has nightmares about the comrades he saw get killed. the best way to explain it is imagining you aresitting under incoming fireand from their (russian) side, it s 50 shells coming toward you, while from our side, it s just one. then you see how your friends are getting torn to pieces, and you realize that any second, it can happen to you, he said. file -

newly recruited soldiers toss their hats as they celebrate the end of their training at a military base close to kyiv, ukraine, on sept. 25, 2023. the main thing is that they leave combat positions during hostilities and their comrades die because of it. we had several situations when units fled, small or large. they exposed their flanks, and the enemy came to these flanks and killed their brothers in arms, because those who stood on the positions did not know that there was no one else around, the official said. that is how vuhledar, a hilltop town that ukraine defended for two years, was lost in a matter of weeks in october, said the 72nd brigade officer, who was among the very last to withdraw. the 72nd was already stretched thin in the weeks before vuhledar fell. only one line battalion and two rifle battalions held the town near the end, and military leaders even began pulling units from them to support the flanks, the officer said. there should have been 120 men in each of the battalion s companies, but some companies ranks dropped to only 10 due to deaths, injuries and desertions, he said. about 20 of the soldiers missing from those companies had gone awol. the percentage has grown exponentially every month, he added. reinforcements were sent once russia wised up to ukraine s weakened position and attacked. but then the reinforcements also left, the officer said. because of this, when one of the 72nd brigade battalions withdrew, its members were gunned down because they didn t know no one was covering them, he said. still, the officer harbors no ill will toward deserters. at this stage, i do not condemn any of the soldiers from my battalion and others. because everyone is just really tired, he said. file - volodymyr, a 51 year old soldier of ukraine s 57th motorised brigade smokes near self-propelled artillery howitzer gvozdika on the front line in the kharkiv region, ukraine, on nov. 7, 2024. prosecutors and the military would rather not press charges against awol soldiers and do so only if they fail to persuade them to return, according to three military officers and a spokesperson for ukraine s state investigative bureau. some deserters return, only to leave again. ukraine s general staff said soldiers are given psychological support, but it didn t respond to emailed questions about the toll desertions are having on the battlefield. once soldiers are charged, defending them is tricky, said two lawyers who take such cases. they focus on their clients psychological state when they left. people cannot psychologically cope with the situation they are in, and they are not provided with psychological help, said attorney tetyana ivanova. soldiers acquitted of desertion due to psychological reasons set a dangerous precedent because then almost everyone is justified (to leave), because there are almost no healthy people left (in the infantry), she said. soldiers considering deserting have sought her advice. several were being sent to fight near vuhledar. they would not have taken the territory, they would not have conquered anything, but no one would have returned, she said. file -

(russian defense ministry press service via ap, file) to flee the kursk region, ukrainian soldiers must walk dozens of kilometers to get back into ukraine, while avoiding russian forces. some soldiers are angry that commanders did not order them to withdraw weeks ago, when it would have been safer to do so. some of ukraine s military leaders believe the daring push into russian territory was essential to preventing further russian advances along the country s northeast. and, by degrading and redirecting russian forces, it enabled ukraine to push back the enemy in the east for the first time since a successful counteroffensive in 2022. other military leaders say the kursk offensive whose political aim appears to have ultimately failed cost ukraine some of its best units and most precious weapons. relatives and friends attend a funeral for ukrainian soldier petro velykiy, who was killed in a battle with the russian troops in russia s kursk region, during a ceremony in chernyhiv, ukraine, nov. 27, 2024. after the fall of sudzha the largest settlement in kursk they controlled, with a pre-war population of 5,000 ukrainian soldiers are pessimistic about their ability to hold what land they have left in the russian region. and they recognize the political stakes of the defeat. i understand that the (russian) side is delaying (ceasefire negotiations) until they reclaim kursk, and only then they will talk, said one ukrainian commander, who spoke on condition of anonymity. but we already, to put it mildly, will not have any levers of influence to return any of our territory. the associated press interviewed five soldiers and commanders, all of whom spoke anonymously, citing legal repercussions for talking about sensitive military matters. soldiers said their ability to hold kursk began to deteriorate the moment soldiers from north korea entered the battle late last year. as time went on, pyongyang s troops only became more effective, ukrainian soldiers said. when one ukrainian drone operator spotted some 40 north korean soldiers near a tree line a few weeks ago, he said he was amazed by the physical fitness of north korean troops. some were capable of quickly running long distances carrying heavy ammunition, he said. i ve never seen anything like that before, he said. shortages of manpower, weaponry and ammunition also hampered ukrainian soldiers, who said that they were outnumbered five to one, on average and ten to one in some areas. over the past three months, the russians gradually wore down the ukrainians. under heavy air assault from the russians, ukrainian troops often had to carry on their backs for 20 or 30 kilometers (12 to 18 miles) reinforcements of ammunition, food and medical supplies. by the time they reach the positions, they are completely exhausted, a ukrainian sergeant said. in this image from video released by the russian defense ministry on oct. 17, 2024, a russian soldier fires a gun toward a ukrainian position in the russian-ukrainian border area in the kursk region, russia. (russian defense ministry press service photo via ap, file) it is unclear how the recent u.s. pause in intelligence sharing influenced the battle for kursk. russian forces seized an estimated 166 square kilometers (64 square miles) in kursk between march 7 and march 10, a period that the pause was in effect. also last week, several hundred russian special forces launched a surprise attack from behind ukraine s defensive lines after crawling 15 kilometers through a natural gas pipeline. and in another instance, ukrainian soldiers that had been positioned to the northwest of sudzha, in lebedivka, simply abandoned their positions, according to a ukrainian drone operator. everyone was leaving randomly, he said, so he eventually left, too. top army chief gen. oleksandr syrskyi said on wednesday he had ordered soldiers to withdraw to more advantageous positions in kursk, saying preserving the lives of soldiers was his priority. but some soldiers said it should have happened sooner. one ukrainian soldier said he and his comrades defied their company commander s orders, and made their own decision to retreat. we re sick and tired of sitting under fire all the time, said the soldier. because all the main roads are being monitored by russian drones, he said soldiers are withdrawing in small groups along tree lines to avoid detection. all the units that are left there, i don t know how they (the command) are going to get them out, because all supply chains have been disrupted, he said, referring to sudzha and surrounding areas. the guys who came out said there were a lot of our dead bodies and a lot of burnt equipment. russian forces are closing in on ukrainian soldiers escape routes from the north and south of sudzha. ukraine still controls a sliver of territory in kursk along the border with sumy. soldiers said attention has shifted to building up defenses along the border to prevent a russian incursion into ukrainian territory. trenches are quickly being dug, but it is not clear if they will be enough. it depends on the power we have, one commander said. a destroyed russian tank sits on a roadside near the town of sudzha, russia, in the kursk region, on aug. 16, 2024. this image was approved by the ukrainian defense ministry before publication. associated press journalist hanna arhirova contributed."

destroyed houses are photographed in irpin, on the outskirts of kyiv, ukraine, saturday, april 30, 2022. as this brutal war of attrition grinds toward its 1,000th day, neither side seems eager to negotiate. president-elect donald trump has saidhe could quickly end the war, though it is unclear how or in whose favor he might tip the scales. this backdrop appears to be driving russia s strategy in eastern ukraine, according to phillips o brien, a professor of strategic studies at the university of st. andrews, scotland. trump could try to force an end to the war by halting the supply of weapons to ukraine, he said. if trump cuts aid to ukraine and a cease-fire leads to a frozen conflict, russia wants to secure as much territory as it can now, o brien said. for ukraine, the key to any cease-fire would be guarantees from the west that it won t allow russia to re-invade in the future. otherwise, o brien said, a cease-fire is a recipe for constant instability in europe. in the war s first year, ukraine lost huge amounts of territory but it alsoachieved notable victories. it resisted a much larger adversary with superior air power to survive as an independent country, and it reclaimed some land throughgutsy counteroffensives, giving the underdog and its wealthy allies the confidence to stay in the fight. in the second year, which was punctuated by ukraine s devastatingloss of bakhmutand its failed counteroffensive, the armies essentially fought to a standstill along a 1,000 kilometer (620 mile) front line. toward the end of that year, the u.s. congress delayed the approval of a 61 billion packageof aid forweapons, and economic and humanitarian assistance. with ukraine s ammunition dwindling, its outlook deteriorated significantly as the war s third year began. in february 2024, the town of avdiivka fellafter months of airstrikes by russia, which used highly destructive soviet-era bombs retrofitted with navigation systems. a ukrainian assault unit commander passes by a dead russian soldier on the front line near andriivka, ukraine, saturday, sept. 16, 2023. the fall of avdiivka created a major breach in ukraine s defenses. when russia later mounted an assault on thenortheastern city of kharkiv,ukrainian troops were stretched further. a bright spot for ukraine came in august, when it launched a surprise incursion into russia. it took and still holds hundreds of square kilometers inthe kursk region.while this could be an important chip in any cease-fire negotiations, it hasn t stopped russian forces from taking more land in ukraine s east. the russians have paid a very high price to keep advancing, but they re willing to pay that price in lives to gain a few more meters of territory each day, said justin crump, head of the british strategic advisory firm sibylline. tens of thousands of soldiers from both countries have been killed since the start of the war in 2022, according to estimates, and the u.n. says at least 11,700 ukrainiancivilians have been killed. while the amount of land russia has gained in 2024 about 2,455 square kilometers (948 square miles) is equal to less than 1 of ukraine s pre-war territory, it is having a psychological impact. with ukraine in retreat, we ve now returned to a period reminiscent of the (war s) first months, said mykola bielieskov, an analyst at cba initiatives center in kyiv. this strengthens russia s position not so much militarily, but in terms of morale. file -

a destroyed russian tank, covered in snow, stands in the yard of a private house in the town of sviatohirsk, ukraine, sunday, feb. 12, 2023. the u.s. has provided more than 64 billion in military aid to ukraine since the war began 1,000 days ago. soldiers worry about what would happen without sustained american support. bravery, heroism, and spirit alone are not enough, said a ukrainian soldier in the eastern donetsk region who spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with military rules. the soldier estimated that where he is stationed russian infantry outnumber ukrainian troops 10 to 1. as the war drags on and the death toll rises, it has become increasingly difficult for ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy to keep replacing troops. what direction the war takes next will depend in large part on how the incoming trump administration plays its hand. trump, who has touted his good relationship with president vladimir putin and called the russian leader pretty smart for invading ukraine, has repeatedly criticized american backing of ukraine. during his only campaign debate with vice president kamala harris, trump twicerefused to directly answera question about whether he wanted ukraine to win raising concerns that kyiv could be forced to accept unfavorable terms in any negotiations. without security guarantees from the west, ukraine could find itself vulnerable to future russian aggression. analysts say a cease-fire based on the current state of the battlefield would set a dangerous precedent, implying that europe s borders are up for grabs through military action something that hasn t happened since world war ii. this would also have a lot of traction in countries like china, india, and elsewhere, said richard connolly, a russia expert at the royal united services institute in london. they could present that as a strategic defeat not only for ukraine, but also for the west. as another winter of war approaches, ukrainian soldiers say they remain resolute. we are standing strong, giving it our all, and we won t surrender, said a battalion chief of staff in the southern region of zaporizhzhia. the most important thing now is not to lose more land. file -

(olivier matthys, pool photo via ap) in a statement after their talks with zelenskyy, the eu leaders called for a rapid stepping up of military support and acceleration in its delivery, in particular air defense systems, ammunition and missiles to protect ukraine s population and energy infrastructure. russia must not prevail, the statement said. the eu is a key supporter of ukraine, acandidate memberof the 27-nation bloc, as it fights russia s invasion that began more than 2 1 2 years ago. zelenskyy had outlined the five-point plan to ukraine s parliament on wednesday without disclosing confidential elements that have been presented in private to key allies, including the united states. hungarian prime minister viktor orb n, widely seen as having the warmest relations of any eu leader with russian president vladimir putin, called zelenskyy s plan more than frightening in a facebook post. he said he would urge major eu powers france and germany to begin negotiations with the russians as soon as possible, in order to find a way out of this situation. rutte said kyiv can rest absolutely assured that 32 allies are united in making sure that collectively, we will do whatever is needed to make sure that ukraine can prevail, that putin will not get his way. he reiterated that ukraine s place is among nato s ranks, but would not say when it might join. nato secretary general mark rutte, right, and ukraine s president volodymyr zelenskyy participate in a media conference during a meeting of nato defense ministers at nato headquarters in brussels, thursday, oct. 17, 2024. zelenskyy told eu leaders that his troops must keep battling russian forces in ukraine while also bringing the war back into russia so that russians can feel what war is like and begin to hate putin for it. zelenskyy said he needs to move some partners forward on the issue. and i think only with the unity in eu we can move and can move not only eu leaders, we can move other leaders. thursday s talks in brussels come as ukrainian troops are struggling to hold off better-equipped russian forces,especially in the eastern donetsk regionwhere they are gradually being pushed back. kyiv is surviving with western help, but ukraine says it is coming too slowly. lithuanian president gitanas nauseda criticized slow western decision-making over ukraine and said it would be a great mistake to think that our hesitance is the best way to de-escalation. ukraine s president volodymyr zelenskyy, left, and european council president charles michel arrive to an eu summit in brussels, thursday, oct. 17, 2024. at theirsummit in washingtonin july, the 32 nato members declared ukraine on an irreversible path to membership. but for now, nato is in a holding pattern. its biggest and most powerful member, the united states, is facing apresidential election. european allies expect little movement on ukraine until a new president takes office in january. beyond that, the united states and european heavyweight germany remain deeply concerned about being dragged into a wider war with nuclear-armed russia, and they lead a group of countries that oppose allowing ukraine to join nato until the conflict ends. corder reported from the hague, netherlands. associated press reporter geir moulson in berlin contributed to this report. find more ap coverage athttps: apnews.com hub russia-ukraine"

(korean central news agency korea news service via ap, file) kyiv, ukraine (ap) for weeks, ukrainian troops braced for an unfamiliar enemy: north korean soldiers sent tobolster moscow s forcesafter ukraine launcheda lightning-fast incursionand seized territory in russia s kursk region over the summer. their arrival marked a new andalarming phase in the war.and while initially inexperienced on the battlefield, north korean troops have adapted quickly a development that could have far-reaching consequences as they gain combat knowledge in the war against ukraine. unlike the russian troops ukraine has been battling fornearly three years, kyiv s forces were uncertain about what to expect from this new adversary, drawn into the war after moscow and pyongyangsigned an agreementpledging military assistance using all means if either were attacked. one ukrainian soldier who has witnessed north koreans in battle described them as disciplined and highly methodical, saying they were more professional than their russian counterparts. the soldier spoke to the associated press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the sensitive military issue. however, other soldiers, including ukrainian special forces, have shared battlefield drone footage on the telegram messaging app mocking their tactics as outdated. nevertheless, there is consensus among ukrainian soldiers, military intelligence and others monitoring developments on the ground: while pyongyang s troops lacked battlefield experiencewhen they arrived, that has been changing quickly. with1.2 million troops, north korea s military ranks among the largest standing armies globally. but its post-korean war foreign engagements have been limited, leaving them inexperienced with modern warfare technologies like drones. for the first time in decades, the north korean army is gaining real military experience, said andrii yusov, spokesperson for ukraine s military intelligence agency. this is a global challenge not just for ukraine and europe, but for the entire world. despite ukrainian, u.s. and south korean assertions that pyongyanghas sent 10,000-12,000 troops to fight alongside russia in the kursk border region, moscow has never publicly acknowledged the north korean forces. while reports of their presencefirst emerged in october, ukrainian troops only confirmed engagementon the ground in december. analysts say that without the influx of north korean troops, russia would have struggled to pursue its strategy of overwhelming ukraine by throwing large numbers of soldiers intothe battle for kursk. russian president vladimir putin, left, and north korea s leader kim jong un smile together in pyongyang, north korea, on june 19, 2024. (gavriil grigorov, sputnik, kremlin photo via ap, file) while moscow s counterattack in kursk has inflicted thousands of ukrainian casualties, kyiv s overstretched forces have managed to hold on to about half of the 984 square kilometers (380 square miles) seized in august, though the situation remains dynamic. besides the symbolic impact of ukraine s success capturing russian territory, control of kursk could also be a bargaining chip in anyceasefire negotiations. according to ukraine s intelligence agency, the north korean soldiers are operating alongside russian units, with the latter providing reconnaissance and electronic warfare support. the north koreans wear russian military uniforms with fake military ids in their pockets, according to a report by a ukrainian military unit that has observed them on the battlefield, and they could easily be mistaken for russian soldiers. the subterfuge means moscow and its representatives at the u.n. can deny the facts, said yusov, the ukrainian military intelligence spokesperson. among the things proving their presence is that they have been heard speaking korean with north korean accents in intercepted communications, yusov said. a destroyed russian tank sits on a roadside near the town of sudzha, russia, in the kursk region, on aug. 16, 2024, in an image approved by the ukrainian defense ministry. he said the north korean troops are using their own weapons and equipment and have learned to cope with theimprovised explosives-laden dronesthat have become emblematic of the war, first-hand experience even some nato-member countries don t have. this is a new level of threat, yusov said. regional countries must prepare for what this means in the future. the north koreans early missteps were largely caused by inexperience, such asmoving in large groups in open terrain, making themeasy targets for drones and artillery strikes. according to the ukrainian military unit s report, the north korean soldiers were spotted easily as they moved in single-file columns through forest in groups of three, with 3 to 5 meters (yards) between soldiers. on open terrain, they moved in dispersed formations of five to 15 soldiers, making them vulnerable and leading to heavy losses. however, during night operations, their movements were swift and units oriented themselves using red flashlights along routes, the report said. they re fast, physically well-prepared, and act strictly according to their algorithms, said the ukrainian soldier who spoke to the ap. if you drill the same routines for years, to the point where they can be executed blindfolded, it will yield results. despite their discipline, their lack of combat experience hindered their effectiveness. the ukrainian military reported that north korean troops often sustained heavy losses, with many killed by drones. on thursday, ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyyput thenumber of killed or wounded north koreans at 4,000, though u.s. estimates are lower, at around 1,200. much of their military doctrine and training is based on strategies and experiences from over half a century ago, said glib voloskyi, a military analyst with the ukrainian think tank cba initiatives center. the large-group formations date to when artillery accuracy was significantly lower, and observing troop movements much more difficult. today, reconnaissance and so-called first-person view drones, or fpvs, that transmit video allowing soldiers to strike targets in real time have made the battlefield highly transparent, and anyone stepping onto it without cover, let alone moving in groups, is immediately spotted. but it is only a matter of time before they acquire the necessary skills to improve their combat effectiveness, which, combined with their discipline and training, could make them a significant military force, voloskyi said. after weeks of fighting,ukrainian soldiers have taken only two prisoners of war.in announcing the capture saturday, zelenskyy said taking them alive was not easy because of efforts to conceal the north koreans presence and avoid their interrogation by ukraine. north korean soldiers avoid surrendering at all costs, zelenskyy said. this may stem from north korean internal propaganda that portrays capture as the ultimate disgrace, analysts said. to be captured alive is considered a betrayal of the country, the leader and everything they stand for, said seongmin lee of the new york-based human rights foundation, who defected from north korea in 2009. this belief is instilled from a young age and reinforced throughout military training, he said. because of the disgrace associated with the capitulation, heroic soldiers are supposed to save the last of their bullets to kill themselves, lee said. lee said he shared photos of dead north korean soldiers with contacts back home. most north koreans don t even know what is going on, he said. dorothy camille shea, the deputy u.s. ambassador to the u.n.,warned of the dangers posed by the rapidly improving battlefield skills the north korean troops are gaining fighting in kursk. north korea is significantly benefiting from receiving russian military equipment, technology and experience, rendering it more capable of waging war against its neighbors, shea told the 15-member u.n. security councilon wednesday. as an added potential benefit, she said, north korea will likely be eagerto leverage these improvements to promote weapons sales and military training contracts globally. associated press reporters tong-hyung kim in seoul, south

(ukrainian emergency service via ap) he added that they talked in detail about defense industry capabilities and direct joint projects with the u.s., particularly in drone technology. they also exchanged views on mutual procurement, investment, and diplomatic cooperation with international partners, zelenskyy said. peace efforts have been fruitless so far.recent direct peace talkshave led only to sporadic exchanges of prisoners of war, wounded troops and the bodies of fallen soldiers. no date has been set for further negotiations. ukrainian officials and the russian defense ministry said another prisoner swap took place friday, though neither side said how many soldiers were involved. zelenskyy said most of the ukrainians had been in russian captivity since 2022. the ukrainian soldiers were classified as wounded and seriously ill. the attack on kyiv began the same daya phone call took placebetween trump and russian president vladimir putin. asked if he made any progress during his call with putin on a deal to end the fighting in ukraine, trump said: no, i didn t make any progress with him today at all. i m very disappointed with the conversation i had today with president putin because i don t think he s there. i don t think he s looking to stop (the fighting), and that s too bad, trump said. damaged cars lie in a yard among other debris after a russian drone and missile attacks in kyiv, ukraine, friday, july 4, 2025. according to yuri ushakov, putin s foreign affairs adviser, the russian leader emphasized that moscow will seek to achieve its goals in ukraine and remove the root causes of the conflict. russia will not back down from these goals, ushakov told reporters after the call. russia s army crossed the border on feb. 24, 2022, in an all-out invasion that putin sought to justify byfalsely sayingit was needed to protect russian-speaking civilians in eastern ukraine and prevent the country from joining nato. zelenskyy has repeatedly called out russian disinformation efforts. the ukrainian response needs to be speedy as russia escalates its aerial attacks. russia launched 5,438 drones at ukraine in june, a new monthly record, according to official data collated by the associated press. ukrainian foreign minister andrii sybiha said earlier this week that russia also launched more than 330 missiles, including nearly 80 ballistic missiles, at ukrainian towns and cities that month. throughout the night, ap journalists in kyiv heard the constant buzzing of drones overhead and the sound of explosions and intense machine gun fire as ukrainian forces tried to intercept the aerial assault. absolutely horrible and sleepless night in kyiv, ukrainian foreign minister andrii sybiha wrote on social media platform x. one of the worst so far. ukraine s economy minister yuliia svyrydenko described families running into metro stations, basements, underground parking garages, mass destruction in the heart of our capital. what kyiv endured last night, cannot be called anything but a deliberate act of terror, she wrote on x. kyiv was the primary target of the countrywide attack. at least 14 people were hospitalized, according to kyiv mayor vitali klitschko. zelenskyy called the kyiv attack cynical. in moscow, the defense ministry claimed its forces targeted factories producing drones and other military equipment in kyiv. ukrainian air defenses shot down 270 targets, including two cruise missiles. another 208 targets were lost from radar and presumed jammed. russia successfully hit eight locations with nine missiles and 63 drones. debris from intercepted drones fell across at least 33 sites. in addition to the capital, the dnipropetrovsk, sumy, kharkiv, chernihiv and kyiv regions also sustained damage, zelenskyy said. emergency services reported damage in at least five of kyiv s 10 districts. vasilisa stepanenko contributed to this report from kyiv, ukraine follow ap s coverage of the war in ukraine athttps: apnews.com hub russia-ukraine."

while his country has thousands of drones, it doesn t have strong missiles that the u.s. makes and suggested both countries can work together for their military goals. president trump says he s interested in such a deal. president donald trump hosted ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy for talks at the white house on friday, with the u.s. leader signaling he s not ready to sell kyiv the

trump, friday, oct. 17, 2025, in washington. washington (ap) president donald trumpon friday called on kyiv and moscow to stop where they are and end their brutal war following a lengthy white house meeting with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy. trump s frustration with the conflict has surfaced repeatedly in the nine months since he returned to office, but with his latest comments he edged back in the direction of pressing ukraine to give up on retaking land it has lost to russia. enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by war and guts, trump said in a truth social post not long after hosting zelenskyy and his team for more than two hours of talks. they should stop where they are. let both claim victory, let history decide! later, soon after arriving in florida, where he s spending the weekend, trump urged both sides to stop the war immediately and implied that moscow keep territory it s taken from kyiv. you go by the battle line wherever it is otherwise it s too complicated, trump told reporters. you stop at the battle line and both sides should go home, go to their families, stop the killing, and that should be it. the comments amounted to another shift in position on the war by trump. in recent weeks, he had shown growing impatience with russian president vladimir putin andexpressed greater opennessto helping ukraine win the war. after meeting with zelenskyy in new york on the sidelines of the annual u.n. general assembly last month, trump even said he believed the ukrainians couldwin back all the the territorythey had lost to russia since putin launched the february 2022 invasion. that was a dramatic shift for trump, who had previously insisted that kyiv would have to concede land lost to russia to end the war. zelenskyy after friday s meeting said it was time for a ceasefire and negotiations. he sidestepped directly answering a question about trump nudging ukraine to give up land. the president is right we have to stop where we are, and then to speak, zelenskyy said when asked by reporters about trump s social media post, which he hadn t seen. ukraine s president volodymyr zelenskyy speaks to reporters in lafayette park across the street from the white house, following a meeting with president donald trump, friday, oct. 17, 2025, in washington. trump s tone on the war shifted after he held alengthy phone call with putinon thursday and announced that he planned to meet with the russian leader in budapest, hungary, in the coming weeks. the president also signaled to zelenskyyon friday that he s leaning against selling him long-range tomahawk missiles, weaponry that the ukrainians believe could be a game changer in helping prod putin to the negotiating table. zelenskyy at the start of the white house talks said he had a proposition in which ukraine could provide the united states with its advanced drones, while washington would sell kyiv the tomahawk cruise missiles. but trump said he was hesitant to tap into the u.s. supply, a turnabout after days of suggesting he was seriously weighing sending the missiles to help ukraine beat back russia s invasion. i have an obligation also to make sure that we re completely stocked up as a country, because you never know what s going to happen in war and peace, trump said. we d much rather have them not need tomahawks. we d much rather have the war be over to be honest. president donald trump, second right, and ukraine s president volodymyr zelenskyy, seated left, sit as reporters ask questions before a lunch in the cabinet room of the white house, friday, oct. 17, 2025, in washington. in an interview with kristen welker of nbc s meet the press, zelenskyy suggested the door was not closed. it s good that president trump didn t say no, but for today, didn t say yes, he said. zelenskyy also said we need tomahawks because it s very difficult just to operate only with ukrainian drones. trump s latest rhetoric on tomahawks was certainly disappointing to the ukrainians. in recent days,trump had shown an opennessto selling ukraine the tomahawks, even as putin warned that such a move would further strain the u.s.-russian relationship. but following thursday s call with putin, trump began downplaying the prospects of ukraine getting the missiles, which have a range of about 995 miles (1,600 kilometers.) zelenskyy had beenseeking the tomahawks,which would allow ukrainian forces to strike deep into russian territory and target key military sites, energy facilities and critical infrastructure. zelenskyy has argued that the potential for such strikes would help compel putin to take trump s calls for direct negotiations to end the war more seriously. putin warned trump during the call that supplying kyiv with the tomahawks won t change the situation on the battlefield, but would cause substantial damage to the relationship between our countries, according to yuri ushakov, putin s foreign policy adviser. president donald trump greets russia s president vladimir putin on the tarmac at joint base elmendorf-richardson in anchorage, alaska, aug. 15, 2025. it was the fifth face-to-face meeting for trump and zelenskyy since the republican returned to office in january, the president said friday it was to be determined if zelenskyy would be involved in the upcoming talks in hungary suggesting a double meeting with the warring countries leaders was likely the most workable option for productive negotiations. these two leaders do not like each other, and we want to make it comfortable for everybody, trump added. but zelenskyy told reporters that the animus toward putin is not about feelings. they attacked us, so they are an enemy for us. they don t intend to stop, zelenskyy added. so they are an enemy. it is not about someone just hating someone else. although, undoubtedly, we hate the enemy. undoubtedly. ukraine s president volodymyr zelenskyy speaks to reporters in lafayette park across the street from the white house, following a meeting with president donald trump, friday, oct. 17, 2025, in washington. trump, going back to his 2024 campaign,insisted he would quickly end the war, but his peace efforts appeared to stall following a diplomatic blitz in august, when he held asummit with putinin alaska and a white house meeting with zelenskyyand european allies. trump emerged from those meetings certain he was on track to arranging direct talks between zelenskyy and putin. but the russian leader hasn t shown any interest in meeting with zelenskyy and moscow has only intensified its bombardment of ukraine. asked friday if he was concerned that putin was stringing him along, trump acknowledged it was a possibility but said he was confident he could handle the russian leader. i ve been played all my life by the best of them, and i came out really well, trump said. he added, i think i m pretty good at this stuff. megerian reported from west palm beach, fla. ap writer susie

(russian defense ministry press service via ap) the incursion didn t significantly change the dynamic of the war, and military analysts say ukraine has lost around 40 of the land it initially captured. russia s defense ministry said sunday that ukraine launched a fresh offensive in the kursk region. it claimed its forces pushed back ukrainian troops, but some reports from russian military bloggers indicated that moscow s forces faced significant pressure. a ministry statement said ukrainian forces attacked about 9 a.m. local time (0600 gmt, 1 a.m. est) near the village of berdin with two tanks, a mine-clearing vehicle and 12 armored combat vehicles with paratroopers. two ukrainian attacks were repelled, it said. ukrainian presidential adviser andriy yermak said there was good news from kursk and that russia was getting what it deserves, while andriy kovalenko, head of ukraine s official centre against disinformation, said on telegram that russian troops were attacked in several places. the associated press was not immediately able to verify the reports. in other developments, local officials said one person was killed and another wounded in russian shelling of the city of nikopol in ukraine s dnipropetrovsk region on sunday. downstream along the dnieper river, at least six people were wounded when russian troops shelled the city of kherson, capital of the region of the same name. settlements along the west bank of the river come under regular shelling from russian-controlled territory on the opposite bank. nine people were wounded in a russian guided bomb attack on the border town of semenivka in ukraine s northern chernihiv region on saturday evening, local officials said. moscow sent 103 drones into ukraine overnight sunday, ukrainian officials said. according to ukraine s air force, 61 drones were destroyed and 42 were lost, likely due to electronic jamming. the russian defense ministry said that 61 ukrainian drones were shot down overnight sunday in western russia. no casualties were reported but rostov regional gov. yuri slyusar said residential buildings and cars were damaged by falling drone debris. morton reported from london. - follow ap s coverage of the war in ukraine athttps: apnews.com hub russia-ukraine"
